# Pytorch-MumfordShahSR
Machine learning model for Super-Resolution



[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/akhaten/Pytorch-MumfordShahSR)


Architecture is based on Split-Bregman algorithm with Mumford-Shah model.

You can use link to Colab to run model but you will think to change device
(gpu more fast than cpu) in your settings.
When you click on colab badge, select `run.ipynb` (you dont need clone repo because there is an colab integration implemented in first cell of notebook).
